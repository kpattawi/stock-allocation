                <p>Above is a table with information about the stocks you entered.  "annual mean" and "annual std" are the 10 year averages of annual mean and standard deviation of returns.</p>
                <h3>{{ largest_ticker }} makes up the largest percent of your portfolio at {{ largest_allocation }}%.</h3>
                <p>While it is okay to own a large position in a single stock, it is recommended to diversify your portfolio by owning many stocks. 25 stocks or more is a common suggestion.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Based on the sectors that you assigned to each stock, here is the allocation of your portfolio by sector:</h3>

                {% for sector in sectors %}
                    <table class="portfolio">    
                        {{sector_titles[loop.index]}}

                    </table>
                {% endfor %}

                <p>As mentioned previously, it is not only recommended to be exposed to multiple stocks, but also a good idea to choose stocks from different sectors.  Owning less correlated stocks will reduce the variance of your portfolio.</p>
